// Type Inference:
// https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/type-inference

// Type Script is Smart !!
// hover over variable

let name = "Harsh ";

let price = 30; //infered as number

let anything;
console.log(anything);
//! anything is infered as any which is a bad practice as we turned of type check for that variable
// noImplicitAny

//?  IN CASE OF VARIABLES IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS
//?  While in case of functions it is necessary

export {};
